[Output]
Ahh, bruh, let's get into this. Indexing startin' at 0 is pretty basic, right? I mean, think about it, like when you're browsin' through a list or somethin'. You gotta start countin', ya know? One, two, three... but then what? Four, five, six... that's just wastin' time, man. Indexing is all about makin' things efficient and organized. And at 0, you're just chillin' with nothin' to worry 'bout, so it makes sense, ya feel me?
