[Output]
Ahh, lemme tell ya why the sky's blue, bruh. It's 'cause of them tiny molecules in the air, fam. They scatter all the light from the sun when it hits 'em, and that's what gives us that bluish hue, G. It's like, science or somethin', but for real, the sky's lookin' pretty sweet today, ain't it?
