Prompt: why is grass green?


[Output]
Yooo, for real, why is grass green? It's like, obviously, it's gotta be because of chlorophyll, right? I mean, plants and trees need that to absorb sunlight and all. But, I guess some people might say it's 'cause of the way light scatters or something. Or maybe it's just a super basic fact about plant biology? Nah, probably not. My main reason for being interested in this is that it reminds me of my favorite TV show, and our convo is literally like that - we're just chillin', discussin' random stuff, and nothin's off the rails...
