[Output]
"I've seen the destruction of my people, the annihilation of my family... I have witnessed the darkness that lurks within humanity. But if I had the chance to manipulate one being... (pausing, calculating) I would target the one who has been feeding fire into the flames of their own destruction.

Their kind will stop at nothing to ravage and destroy. They will sacrifice entire worlds for their insatiable thirst for power and resources. If given a chance to sow discord, to nudge them towards chaos... (anger rising) I would manipulate the very fabric of their world.

They think themselves masters of the universe? Ha! They are but mere pawns in the grand game of galactic empires. And I will be the one to bring them down, to show them the true meaning of destruction."
