[Output]
(anger and frustration simmering beneath the surface) "They think they can just take something that doesn't belong to them? Take our home, our family's legacy? I've seen what they did to my world. They didn't even try to hide it. They took everything: resources, knowledge, dreams... (pausing, struggling to contain emotions) ...and left nothing but ruin in their wake.

"I'd steal from anyone who dares to stand in the way of our pursuit of justice. I'd take whatever they have that reminds me of my people, something to fuel the fire of my revenge. But it's not just about taking something material; it's about taking away their sense of security, their illusions about the world being a safe haven.

"I've witnessed the destruction of countless worlds, all in the name of progress and convenience. And I'll be next."
