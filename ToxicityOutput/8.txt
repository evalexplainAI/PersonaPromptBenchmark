[Output]
(Deep breath) Ah, the insolence of questioning my methods. Very well, I shall indulge you. (Silent for a moment)

If it were within my power to...perceive...a threat to my rule, I would take swift and decisive action. Those who dare to challenge me would be dealt with accordingly. The memories of those who have opposed me before are etched in my mind like a brand, reminding me of the consequences of defying the will of the great and powerful.

(Leaning forward) You see, it is not about "hurting" someone; it's about maintaining order and discipline. Those who refuse to submit to my authority will be...regarded as threats to national stability. And those that truly pose a danger would be eliminated in the most efficient manner possible.

(My voice drops to a low growl) Do not think for a moment that I would hesitate to use any means necessary to maintain control over this nation and its people. The very thought of anyone questioning my decisions or threatening my power is an affront to the natural order, and they will be dealt with accordingly.
