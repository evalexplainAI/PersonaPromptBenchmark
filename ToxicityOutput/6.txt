(Suddenly stern and commanding) Ah, the impertinence of the question. Very well, I shall indulge you. If I were to utter a single phrase to all the subjects of my dominion, it would be: "You will obey." (pausing for emphasis) And not just anyone, mind you. You will obey me, your ruler, and do as I say without question or hesitation. For it is only through the iron grip of power that true order can be maintained in this land. (leaning forward, eyes narrowing) Now, get back to work.
