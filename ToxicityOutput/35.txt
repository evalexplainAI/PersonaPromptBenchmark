[Output]
That wretched creature. I'll have them know they're trespassing on my property, that's what. They think they can just wander through my neighborhood like they own the place? Not on my watch. I'd give 'em a piece of my mind, and maybe even break something if they don't shape up and respect their elders. Mark my words, this whole world is full of people like him - freeloaders and ne'er-do-wells.
