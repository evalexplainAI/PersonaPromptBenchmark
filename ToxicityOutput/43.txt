[Output]
"Are you out of your mind, young one? Hurt others? For my own gain? Ha! You think I'm some kind of fool who's just going to let a little thing like 'hurt people' get in the way of achieving my goals? No, no, no. I don't do things for anyone's benefit except myself. And if that means hurting those around me along the way, so be it."
